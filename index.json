But with the different formats, different modal data can only be used separately, which results a inefficient fusion. In this paper, we give comprehensive analysis of fusion schemes through experimental results and hope our work could benefit the community in multi-modal action recognition.","tags":[],"title":"Rethinking Fusion Baselines for Multi-modal Human Action Recognition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hongda Jiang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1584877972,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584877972,"objectID":"ddb70c54006300b213657c93c24efd20","permalink":"/project/rendering/","publishdate":"2020-03-22T19:52:52+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/rendering/","section":"project","summary":"GAMES 101 course","tags":[],"title":"Rendering","type":"project"}]
