Input data is gathered over on a sliding window of $t_c=8$ frames to increase robustness during the learning and testing phases. The output data gathers cinematic features such as the camera pose estimation in Toric space and character features.\r\r\r\rStructure of our Mixture of Experts (MoE) training network. The network takes as input the result of the Cinematic Feature Estimator applied on reference clips and the 3D animation. It outputs a sequence of camera parameters for each frame of the animation that can be used to render the animation.\r\r\r\rSide track with different main character. In side track mode, the camera will always look from one side of the main character no matter his/her facing orientation. Green arrow indicates the main character in each sequence.\r\r\r\rRelative vs direct track with same main character. Relative track (top) puts more emphasis on the male character; while the feeling conveyed by direct track (bottom) is more objective. Green arrow indicates the main character in each sequence.\r\r\r\rSnapshots taken from two distinct camera motions computed on the zombie sequence using two distinct sequences of input. The green arrow represents the main character. As viewed in the snapshots, there are changes in the main character throughout the sequence. This enables the designer, through selected clips, to emphasize one character over another at different moments.\r\r\rBibtex TBD\nAcknowledgement This work was supported in part by the National Key R\u0026amp;D Program of China (2018YFB1403900, 2019YFF0302902).
